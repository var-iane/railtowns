    <p class="text-lg">Welcome to the United States of America around 1850. It's young, overconfident, and growing too fast for its skin. People keep sailing over to find their version of the American Dream, and it's getting very crowded in those cities in the North.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">Meanwhile, there's the whole West. So much land to take, so much money to make.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">The federal government finds a perfect partner in railroad companies. In exchange for millions of acres of free land on which to lay tracks, the railroads are going to help the United States settle the West.</p>

    <!-- [image fades in of US with settled west] -->

    <p class="text-lg">The story of the Western railroads is one of federal and corporate greed, forced displacement, false promises, mass production, and boom-and-bust capitalism.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">It's told in three parts. Use the nav bar at the top!</p>
