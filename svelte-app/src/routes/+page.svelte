    <p>Welcome to the United States of America around 1850. It's young, overconfident, and growing too fast for its skin. People keep sailing over to find their version of the American Dream, and it's getting very crowded in those cities in the Northeast.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, there's the whole West: so much land to take.</p>

    <p>The federal government finds a perfect partner in railroad companies. In exchange for millions of acres of free land on which to lay tracks, the railroads are going to help the United States settle the West.</p>

    <!-- [image fades in of US with settled west] -->

    <p>Railroad companies planned their routes, platted towns along them, and then promoted these towns aggressively to potential settlers. They did this at incredible speed.</p>

    <p>Some railroad towns became important cities. Many more remained small agricultural or mining towns, fully dependent on the lifeblood of the railroad (and the railroad dependent on the town in kind). And some disappeared as quickly as they came.</p>

    <p>The story of the Western railroads is one of federal and corporate greed, forced displacement, false promises, and boom-and-bust capitalism. It's told in three parts. Use the nav bar at the top!</p>
